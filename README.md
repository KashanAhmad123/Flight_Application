# Flight_Application
To develop a system that provides real-time flight status updates and notifications to passengers, we can break it down into several components. Here is a high-level overview of the system along with its key features:

System Architecture

    Frontend: User interface for displaying flight status and receiving notifications.
    Backend: Server-side logic to process data, send notifications, and integrate with airport systems.
    Data Integration: Pull data from airport databases and external APIs.
    Notification System: Send push notifications via SMS, email, or app notifications.

#Technologies

    Frontend: React.js for a responsive web application.
    Backend: Node.js with Express.js for handling server-side logic.
    Database: MongoDB for storing user and flight information.
    Message Broker: Kafka or RabbitMQ for handling real-time notifications.
    APIs: Integration with external airport APIs for flight data.
    Notification Services: Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email, Firebase for app notifications.

System Components and Flow
1. Frontend

    React.js Application:
        Display flight status updates.
        Allow users to subscribe to notifications.

2. Backend

    Node.js with Express:
        Endpoints to fetch flight status.
        Endpoints to subscribe/unsubscribe from notifications.

3. Data Integration

    API Integration:
        Pull real-time data from airport databases or mock data sources.
        Store flight status updates in MongoDB.

4. Notification System

    Message Broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ):
        Publish flight status updates.
        Consumers to send notifications (SMS, email, app).
